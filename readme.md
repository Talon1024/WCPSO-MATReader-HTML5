MAT Reader
==========

This is a JavaScript/HTML5 app that reads VISION engine (Wing Commander: Prophecy/Secret Ops) MAT
texture files, and displays them on HTML5 canvases.

How to use
----------

Just select some MAT files using the file selector, and they will be loaded
automatically, and displayed to you as they are being loaded. Once the load is
complete, you can hover over each image rendered from the MAT file, and you can
see which MAT corresponds to the image you are hovering over.
